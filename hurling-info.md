Hurling is a sport, but is more than a sport, it is a way of movement.

Accoridng to the Indy GAA:

> Hurling is a traditional Irish field sport and one of the five Gaelic games
> promoted by Irelandâ€™s Gaelic Athletic Association. Despite sporadic periods of
> widespread interest in the U.S., the sport has endured a historically sparse
> presence here. Since the first accounts of North American hurling matches in
> the late 18th century, activity has been centered in a few large cities, and
> the game has been played primarily by Irish immigrants.
> 
> In recent times, however, Americans outside the traditional centers of Irish
> culture have gained a passion for the sport. Exposure to hurling has
> increased through media such as satellite television and the Internet, as
> well as from the ongoing promotion by the GAA and our local governing body,
> the North American GAA.
