The Stanford Hurling Club was officially founded as a student group at Stanford
in 2008, although it had its beginnings in 2006 when sophomore John Mulrow
initially tried to bring the sport to campus.

In 2009, Stanford won the first ever collegiate cup competition in North America 
by defeating Cal in a best of three series.

The start at Stanford seeded the growth of the collegiate GAA in North America,
but at Stanford club participation waned as the COVID-19 pandemic approached.
Stanford Hurling is not an active club right now, 
but we aim to return the club to full status and resume the
[winning streak](https://www.gaa.ie/hurling/news/gaa-world-news-stanford-university-win-five-row/).
