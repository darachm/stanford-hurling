We always want to share this sport with anyone, and we also want to work with
people to build themselves as players and build us up as a team
(and beat Cal).

Here are a few ways to check it out:

- If you want to just check it out once, 
    email us and we'll let you know where the 
    next practice, game, or exhibition is. Thank you for your interest!

- If you're new or just beginning and want to learn the basics, email us
    to swing by training sometime. We can show you a few of the skills there.
    If you'd prefer to learn with a few other new folks, email us and we'll
    set up a introduction demo sometime.

- If you can already lift and puck the ball, email us to get the information on
    trainings and help us schedule it for when it works for you.
    Players from other teams (for example, St. Joes or *even Cal*) are 
    very welcome to just drop in (email us for when/where) or train 
    consistently with us. 

Yada yada
