We've been holding regular practices on Thursdays, and have enough people 
turning out for the last two to run small 4-a-side games. 
We need more helmets, we're almost out!

It's been great to get a mix of undergrads, grad students, postdocs, staff,
and neighbors out, including some from the local clubs to show
us a thing or two about hurling.

The Stanford hurling community has gotten back into form quickly, and
we might be ready for a challenge match soon ... ?

Stay tuned!
