Stanford bounced back from it's first loss to Cal by one point, and from 
2009 to 2015 dominated the California Collegiate Championships.
These competitions were mostly against Cal Berkeley, 
and later the noble and brave UC Davis Culchies.

Stanford made it to finals in the collegiate playoffs at the National Playoffs
in 2015 (in Montana), our first trip to the playoffs.
