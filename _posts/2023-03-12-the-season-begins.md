...and we're back from the winter now. California's been getting soaked by rain
storms but we've been able to get out and find a few more solid patches of turf
to run and train on. So, practices are happening again.

A few things have changed:

- First, we have a Slack instance now. If you want to join, go ahead and email
    us at hurling.stanford@gmail.com to get an invite code.

    That will be a place to get news and chat about team training, etc, all
    in a platform where you get to control what notifications you get and
    when/how. Great.

    For example, check out my tips for strength training you can get up to.
    Happy to help someone figure out when and how to start lifting, so hit me
    up on the hurling Slack.

- We're at Wilbur field on **Wednesdays** for two weeks, for the 15th and 22nd.
    We'll be out there at **6:00pm**. We've only planned for two weeks because
    another local club's practices may be on Wednesday, so we will likely switch
    the Stanford one to another day.

    Have an opinion about when? Let us know.

- Last year was more drills, and I really want to turn our practices into
    small-sided games. So the more we can get out, the more fun we can have.
