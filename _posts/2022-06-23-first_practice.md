It's been a few years since Stanford hurling met, trained, and played.
The COVID pandemic was a one-two punch for the club, as the public-health 
tragedy of incomprehensible magnitude washed over this country.
Stanford hurling was dormant for several years, as was much of the world.

But, in 2022 a few players from St. Joseph's hurling club who worked at Stanford
sparked a resurgence. With the word going out, club almuni were ready across 
the campus and across the world to reboot the club, 
dusting off old training equipment, organizations, listservs, websites, 
and advice to reboot the club.

On this day was the first practice back for Stanford hurlers in a while.
New-to-hurling folks took to it quickly. While we have a long way to go until
we can field a full squad and return to national-level competition,
the deep support from alumni and the Stanford Irish Association will 
give us the best shot at starting a new wave - and new generation - 
of hurlers at Stanford.
