We're working to promote, train, and organize the sport of hurling
among the Stanford University community.
We aim to return to collegiate competition (with Berkelely), 
but we also want to share the simple fun of just pucking around with a hurley
and friends.

See above for 
[what hurling is](/hurling),
how to [check it out](/check-it-out),
our [calendar](/calendar),
and information/history of [the club](/club-info).
