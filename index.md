The purpose of the Stanford Hurling Organization is to promote the Irish sport
of hurling among the Stanford University community. 
Inter-collegiate competition is our main goal for training and events,
but we also want to promote comradery and just having fun!
So, whether it's to play competitively, get a great workout, 
or just hit around and make some new friends while learning more 
about Irish culture, join us at our next event.
