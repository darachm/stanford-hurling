We're a hurling team based at Stanford University.
We train together to compete against our local rivals Berkeley and challenge
matches with the local GAA teams.

We aim to share the practice of hurling with our community.
We are building up our team with the aim of competing, but we also
sharing the simple fun of just pucking around.

Contact us if you're interested in trying it out, watching a practice, or 
even watching a game.
