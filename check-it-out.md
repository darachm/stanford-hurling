We welcome anyone to meet up with us and learn more about hurling.
Here are a few ways:

1. **Visit or participate in a practice:** 
    contact us via email or one of our social media accounts 
    (bottom of the page) to get more information.

    We are recruiting anyone to the team who wants to train and compete,
    with the support and coaching of the club.
    We play co-ed, so males+females+humans are all great for the team,
    practices, and organization. 
    Mo' diversity mo' wisdom, so swing on by.

    If you're **new or beginning** and want to learn the basics, 
    we can show you a few of the skills at a practice.
    If you'd prefer to learn with a few other new folks, 
    email us and we'll set up a introductory demo or one-on-one sometime.

    If you can **already lift and puck the ball**, 
    we can help you refine your fitness and skills and we hope you can
    also represent the team in future competitions (but no commitment).

    **Players from other teams** 
    (for example, St. Joes or *even Cal I suppose*) are 
    *very welcome* to just drop in or even train consistently with us. 

    If you want to **just watch** that's great, and if you want to
    **give it a try** we recommend wearing shoes and pants you can 
    jog or run on grass with. Or not. Whatever you can do.
    Thank you for your interest!

1. **Watch a game** (check our calendar for games, 
    but nothing is planned yet...)

1. **Get in contact** if you have any other ideas for outreach or 
    how we can help enrich the culture of Stanford University by 
    sharing this amazing sport and cultural practice of movement.


<!--
While we are primarily focused on building up our team for competition,
we are also interested in sharing hurling as not just a sport but a practice
of movement with folks who might not want to play competitively. 
It's quite fun to smack a ball back and forth with bats designed for catching,
balancing, and sending the ball.
