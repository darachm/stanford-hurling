The Stanford hurling team was founded years ago, but had lapsed just as the
pandemic was kicking off.
Here, we are rebooting the old club to share the practice of hurling with
more people.

We aim to both train people to contend in competitive hurling matches
(taking on Cal Berkeley)
but also to share the fun of friends simply pucking around to pass the time.
Hurling is a sport, but is more than a sport, it is a way of movement.
